	<p class="pis-section-title">General Information</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">The aim of this study is to investigate how people make decisions and learn information.</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">We appreciate your interest in participating in this online survey.  You have been invited to participate as you have indicated that you might be interested in participating, and you are currently (i) aged 18-65 years, (ii) fluent English speaking, (iii) have normal or corrected-to- normal vision, (iv) neurologically healthy, (v) not on any medication with psychoactive effects (e.g., antidepressants or medication for anxiety), and (vi) have not taken part in closely related previous studies. Please read through this information before agreeing to participate (if you wish to) by ticking the ‘yes’ box below.</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">You may ask any questions before deciding to take part by contacting the researcher (details below).</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">The Principal Researcher is Nikolay Petrov, who is attached to the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford.  This project is being completed under the supervision of Nicholas Yeung.</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">In this online task, you will be asked to make decisions about whether a hidden computer\'s card is lower or higher than your own visible playing card after which you will be able to learn more information about the trial. If you make a correct choice (dependent partly on your skill and partly on luck), you will be awarded bonus points, which will be subsequently converted to money. The testing session is expected to last approximately 35 minutes. No background knowledge is required. Data will be collected in an anonymised manner by assigning a random identification number to every participant included in the study. This identifier will link all research data collected, but will not be retraceable to fully identifiable personal data, such as your name (i.e., we will not retain a list of participant names against numbers). Your IP address will not be stored.</p>
	
	<p class="pis-section-title">Do I have to take part?</p>
	<p class="instructions-text">No. Please note that participation is voluntary.  If you do decide to take part, you may withdraw at any point for any reason before submitting your answers by closing the browser.  However, we are only able to reimburse participants who complete all study activities.</p>
